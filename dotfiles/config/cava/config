[general]
framerate = 80

#█▓▒░ The number of bars (0-200). 0 sets it to auto (fill up console).
#█▓▒░ Bars' width and space between bars in number of characters.
bar_width = 1
bar_spacing = 1

gradient = 1

[output]
#█▓▒░ Ouput method. Can be 'ncurses', 'noncurses' or 'raw'.
#█▓▒░ 'noncurses' is for systems that does not suport ncurses.
#█▓▒░ 'raw' is a 16 bit data stream of the bar heights that can be used to send to other applications.
#█▓▒░ 'raw' defaults to 200 bars, which can be adjusted in the 'bars' option above.
method = ncurses

#█▓▒░ Visual channels. Can be 'stereo' or 'mono'.
#█▓▒░ 'stereo' mirrors both channels with low frequencies in center.
#█▓▒░ 'mono' averages both channels and outputs left to right lowest to highest frequencies.
channels = mono

[smoothing]
#█▓▒░ Percentage value for integral smoothing. Takes values from 0 - 100.
#█▓▒░ Higher values means smoother, but less precise. 0 to disable.
integral = 85

#█▓▒░ Set gravity percentage for "drop off". Higher values means bars will drop faster.
#█▓▒░ Accepts only non-negative values. 50 means half gravity, 200 means double. Set to 0 to disable "drop off".
gravity = 100
